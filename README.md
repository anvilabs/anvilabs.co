# Installation

Project requires node 6.2.1 and npm 3.9.3. The best way to manage node versions
I found is [n](https://github.com/tj/n).

Installation.

    $ sudo npm install -g n
    $ n 6.2.1

Type `n` to prompt selection of an installed node.
Use the up / down arrow to navigate, and press enter or the right arrow to select, or ^C to cancel:

    $ n

    Î¿ 6.2.1
      4.4.3
